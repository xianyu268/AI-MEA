Inherited non-invasive intracellular recording by machine learning-coupled microelectrodes-electroporation system.

Herein, an “Inherited Non-invasive Intracellular Recording” methodology was proposed, which was based on the fusion of artificial intelligence with MEA-electroporation system (AI-MEA-EP) to enable prolonged monitoring of intracellular APs in cardiomyocytes. It utilized MEA-electroporation (MEA-EP) for minimally invasive collection of intracellular signals transiently (~1 min), as well as non-invasive recording of extracellular signals in long-term. The recorded extracellular APs were converted into corresponding intracellular APs by a CNN-LSTM-based AI model enhanced by model self-calibration. The intracellular APs detected by the AI-MEA-EP exhibited high consistency with those physically obtained through MEA-EP. It was demonstrated to monitor cardiac intracellular AP under drug treatments and glucose challenging during >5 consecutive days. This method offered unique solution to achieve prolonged intracellular for advancing cardiac research.
